This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn''t end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion.
 I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton''s reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, "the story of my life." 
Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.

Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. 
Nothing is sacred.

Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.
The film''s simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy''s comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. 
Cluzet isn''t your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you''ll know it when you see it).

 Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype. The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place. 
Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It''s like the writers didn''t care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments.
 Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes. Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this. The last battle was epic and beautiful but that''s all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch.

1. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you "don''t know that you''re missing till it''s gone". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the "less projecting voices" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing "broadway aspect" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???
2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?
Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie "a whole package" was just not there.

 In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd "Red" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope.

When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.
Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as "a film that rewards intellect", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. 
The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.
Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan''s previous film, The Dark Knight.
While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding.

His entire life is broadcasted for all the world to see. He is raised to believe that there is no real reason to try and leave his perfect "island". Throughout the film, we watch as Truman tries time and time again to discover the truth behind his life, and as he attempts to escape. 
The struggle he experiences while trying to break free from the artificial world can be seen as a satirical message. The world is trying to oppress you, and although difficult, you can escape. This is supported by a statement made by the creator of the Truman show. He said, "We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. It''s as simple as that". Several other hidden messages (Ideas) appear throughout the film. 
All the actors who play roles in Truman''s life, are indeed fake. Despite directly lying to a person whose life is immediately affected by that lie, the actors/actresses show no emotion for Truman.

The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it''s excitement and holds the audience''s attention to the end.
Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.
As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. ', 97, 3, 2);

This time, there is no grade for the script, 10 is too low, maybe 10++ would suffice. I must agree that in everything around us we can see only what we are capable to see, but this movie gives so many levels and many people would see it differently and ALL WILL BE THRILLED by this movie.
People who are interested in the phenomenon of ''Big Brother'',a kind of TV voyeurism (so present today) will see the ultimate human desire to observe somebody''s life, from its beginning, and without consent of the person which is the object of that observing. There is nothing special in this man who is watched, but we like to have mirrors of our lives in other people (who knows why).
Of course, the next layer is ethical: do we have the right to watch somebody''s life, because we don''t talk about a rat, but a human being who doesn''t know that he is watched in a TV show.
If we go further, we must ask ourselves, what is real in our life? There is is always some possibility that we are observed, directed, guided, monitored..., by somebody and our life is not so authentic as we used to think.
Next layer: this movie talks about freedom and personal choice. How we want to be free, no matter what are the other alternatives are. Free to love who we want, free to go, free as much as it is possible. Of course, if we want to be free, if our mind and society stop us.
FINALLY... The most interesting level is the spiritual one.This is a guidebook of the spiritual path. At first, this world is so secure and predictable place. We have our little lives and we can define everything what is important for us, to have some simplification of reality, to feel safe. This kind of ordinary life is a bit boring, but we are in a herd, we are not alone in our dungeon.

 I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton''s reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, "the story of my life." 
Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.

 Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype. The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place. 
Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It''s like the writers didn''t care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments.
 Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes. Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this. The last battle was epic and beautiful but that''s all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch.

1. The broadway voices of Nathan lane, Ernie sambella and Jeremy irons really added that punch to the characters that you "don''t know that you''re missing till it''s gone". Here I feel these characters fall flat with the "less projecting voices" and it was very noticeable. Seth Rogan was the best, but still, the missing "broadway aspect" these voices carried made the movie fall flat where it just could have been cast better???
2. So many of the little humorous exchanges with the hyenas and with rafiki were taken away. Part of the magic of the lion king was in the humor which was lost in this film. They did try and compensate a little, but I feel the laughter was just not there. Whoopi goldberg and cheech Marin were comedians, why was this not explored more to bring new comedians in for the hyenas roles?
Without the booming voices and humour, you realize that the movie is lacklustre where you are left with the story and the cinematography only. The cinematography is fantastic and I know this is a super hard movie to live up to the original, but I feel a lot of the magic that make this movie "a whole package" was just not there.
